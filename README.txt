What the web app is for.

This Web app is to display the information found on a cv in a formatted and segmented way.

What imports (if any) that have been used

import React from 'react', ReactDOM from 'react-dom', BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch from 'react-router-dom'

What you would do differently if you were to develop the application further.

I would change it to be one page but have the navigation bar at the top direct you to the 
correct part of the page and i would also add a portfolio section to include projects developed 

Visual Studio extensions:
ESLint
Debugger for Chrome
